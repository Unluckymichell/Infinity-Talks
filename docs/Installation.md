# Install to your server

## Introduction

While I'll be hosting the bot for free for now, it's a good idea to host it yourself for long-term reliability.

## Requirements

-   You will need Node Version 15+ (Older versions might work, but I won't test it)

Yes that's it!

## Setup

-   Clone this repos master branch to your device with node
-   Run npm install
-   Lauch using npm start

You can also start the index.js directly in the project master with node\
Just make sure to run npm build before executing

## Additional tips

Im running the bit using pm2 Process Manage\
It's a easy way of getting auto start and helps you keep the bot online 24/7
