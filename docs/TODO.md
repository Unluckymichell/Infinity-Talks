# Features to do

This is my personal list for features to implement.\
I know there are tools for this and github even has one but I just like good old md file!

## Finaly have a help menu

-   Just why didn't I do this until now?

## Permissions

-   All actions will have a assigned permission
-   Permissions are non case sensitive dot seperated lists (command.ping, command.help, command.test)
-   Default permission will be granted to everyone
-   Roles can be set to overwrite default permissions
-   Administrator discord permission will include all sub permissions

## Webpage

-   Sidebar text should not be copyable, highlight selected guild
-   Add all new db settings
-   Add languages to the page

## Text channel things `LOW PRIORITY`

-   Implement option to create text channels for voice channels
    -   Store connected voice channel in channel description
    -   Experimental only show text channel to people in voice channel
