# Infinity-Talks (V2)

Infinity-Talks is a nodejs discord bot for managing "talks" (voice channels) for global use (Not a private channel bot!).

## Disclaimer

The first version of this bot has a lot of bugs and im now rewriting it completely in [Eris](https://abal.moe/Eris/).
Util Version 2 it's not recommend to use this bot. (See progress in [rewrite](https://github.com/Unluckymichell/Infinity-Talks/tree/rewrite) branch)

## Overview

This bot is not meant as a private channel bot. There are plenty other good solutions.

It's intended to big servers having free open "talks" that can be used by any member.
The main concept is as simple as having always an empty talk to join without occupying to much space.
Users that have joined into one of these talks are able to lock the channel or edit basic stuff like the bitrate.

Every feature of the bot is configurable and I'm open to suggestions for further features.
